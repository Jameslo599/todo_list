Functionality

This todo list was made to display my understanding and ability of OOP using factory functions to dynamically create 'todo' tasks.
Code formatters such as eslint and Prettier were utilized for the first time to train me on how to write cleaner code and also make my code more readable and 'single-origin' for other developers. I was really impressed with how easy to use the programs were and plan on formatting the code from my previous projects using this. I also furthered strengthened my ability to use Webpack and imported the 'date-fns' module to help manipulate my date values. Babel was also implemented but I'm not too familiar with it, so I didn't utilize it to the fullest potential.

Users are able to create 'todo' tasks by clicking the 'plus' button and then inputting data values for title, description, due date, priority and project. Tasks then populate in the specified project folder and can be deleted or editted. I implemented a sidebar which can be minimized by clicking the 'hamburger' button in the top-left. The sidebar houses all the projects and the user can create custom projects by filling in the text bar. Local storage is also utilized to save tasks and projects for future use. This application is also responsive.

Initially, the project started out straightforward, but I hit a wall when trying to implement the edit function as it would not change the values of the specified task. I ended up having to refactor my code three times, but this was actually a great learning experience as I got better at OOP by converted most of my code to factory functions. I also learned a great deal in object inheritance.

Overall, this project was a very, very good learning experience and I feel like I finished this project as a much better developer.
The skills I learned and honed from this project are invaluable and I'm excited to continue with my next project!
